## Introduction

PlaNus is a **task managing desktop application** for students in NUS with many projects and deadlines, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) with the benefits of Graphical User Interface (GUI). PlaNus reduces the time spent by students in task management as adding tasks and lessons is now simple and quick!

Objectives of PlaNus:
1. Provide students with a detailed breakdown of how much time they spend on their tasks and lessons in their respective modules.
2. Allow students to have a calendar view of their schedule.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Set-up

1. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed in your computer.
2. Download the latest planus.jar from **[here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/releases/)**.

    ![setup](images/Setup.png)

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for PlaNus.
4. Double-click the file to start the app. Upon launching PlaNus, you should see the following user interface.

    ![sample PlaNus](images/SamplePlanus.png)

5. Alternatively, in command prompt (for Windows) or terminal (in MacOS), go to the directory where planus.jar is stored and enter `java -jar planus.jar`.To open command prompt (for Windows) or terminal (in MacOS), simply search for them in your computer.
6. You may try out some commands listed in the [command summary](#command-summary) to explore the app.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Features

This section is a comprehensive walkthrough of the features in PlaNus.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format**<br>
* Words highlighted are code snippets. <br>
    - e.g. `title`
* Words in **upper case** are the parameters (i.e. user input) to be supplied by the user.<br>
  - e.g. in `event title:TITLE`, `TITLE` is a parameter which users can determine.
  - For example, users can type `title:homework 1` or `title:assignment`.

* Items in **square brackets** are optional fields that a user can provide to add more details to the command. <br>
  - e.g. command `event title:Title [desc:DESCRIPTION]` means that the `desc` field is optional.
  - In the above case, users can either type `event title:homework 1` or `title:homework 1 desc:science project` if they want to store a description of the event.

* Items with `...` after them can be keyed in multiple times.<br>
  - e.g. `delete-task INDEX...` can be used as both `delete-task 1` or `delete-task 1 2 3`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  - e.g. commands `deadline title:TITLE desc:DESCRIPTION` and `deadline desc:DESCRIPTION title:TITLE` are the same.

* the time taken refers to the time in minutes that the user took to complete the specific deadline.
* the index and time taken **must be a positive integer** 1:20, 2:30, 3:120, ...

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes**<br>

</div>

Examples:

* `list-task` followed by `done 2:30 3:60`
    * Marks the 2nd and the 3rd tasks in the results of the `list` command status to be done, and records that the user has spent 30 minutes to finish the 2nd task, and 60 minutes to finish the 3rd task.
* `find-task title:homework` followed by `done 1:20`

1) Type in the command box the following command:
* `done 1:50`

![mark_as_done](./images/DoneCommand.png)

* Edits the task(s) at the specified INDEX.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed task list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes**<br>

* If different fields are provided in the command, all the provided fields of the specified task will be updated.
* If a deadline has a status of **complete**, it cannot be edited.

![list task](images/ListTask.png)

This displays all tasks in the task list.

2) Type `edit-task` and the index of the task, followed by the new date and time you want to update the task with.
For example, if we want to change the first task start time to be an hour earlier, we can type
`edit-task 1 from:18:00` in the command box.

![edit task](./images/EditTask.png)

This changes the start time of the first task to 18:00 which is one hour earlier than the original start time. You can view the task with the updated information in the task list.

![edit task result](./images/EditTaskResult.png)

Other examples:
* `edit-task 1 title:play games`

## 4. Calendar View

The calendar view is located in the area shown below.

![calendar view](./images/CalendarView.png)

Users can use the calendar view to see what tasks and lessons they have in the previous week, current week and next 
two weeks as shown below.

![calendar view week](./images/CalendarViewWeek.png)

Calendar view displays:
* Deadlines
* Events
* Lessons

<br>

## 5. Data Analysis

Users can use the pie chart and list of modules to visualise how much time is spent on each module. Each module is 
denoted by the `tag` on its task/lesson.

![data analysis](./images/DataAnalysis.png)

How does it work:
* Each module has a **time spent on tasks** and **time spent on lessons**.
* When a `deadline` is marked as done, it contributes towards **time spent on tasks** for that module. 
* When an `event` has occurred, it contributes towards **time spent on tasks** for that module.
* When a `lesson` has occurred, it contributes towards **time spent on a lesson** for that module.

Example:

![data analysis example](./images/DataAnalysisExample.png)
* The first lesson in the list:
    * Title of "CS2103T Lecture"
    * Only occurred one time during the past week
    * Has a duration of 4 hours from 12:00 to 16:00

Therefore, the **time analysis for the week** will show that the **time spent on lessons** with the CS2103T `tag` as
240 minutes (4 hours).
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes**<br>

* Version 1.3:
    * Only time spent on each module in the **past week** is displayed.

* In the next iteration:
    * A breakdown of time spent on each module in the **past week** and of **all time** is displayed.
</div>

<br>
