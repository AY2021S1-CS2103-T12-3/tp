## Project: PlaNus

PlaNus is a desktop application for **managing tasks, optimized for use via a Command Line
Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can
type fast, PlaNus can get your tasks managed faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
