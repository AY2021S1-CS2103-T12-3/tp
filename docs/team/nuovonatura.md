## Introduction

This page serves to document my contributions to the project PlaNus under NUS module CS2103T in AY20/21 semester 1. 

## Project: PlaNus

PlaNus is a **task managing desktop application** for students in NUS with many projects and deadlines, 
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) with the benefits of Graphical User Interface (GUI).
PlaNus reduces the time spent by students in task management as adding tasks and lessons is now simple and quick!


Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Features**: 
* **Project management**: 

  * Managed releases  `v1.2`, `v1.3` and `v1.4` (3 releases including issues and deadlines) on GitHub
